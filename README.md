# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Challenge

This project is a solution to the [QR code component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) on Frontend Mentor.

## Project Description

This challenge focuses on building a simple, responsive QR code component. The goal is to accurately replicate the provided design using HTML, CSS, and in this case,  I utilize React with TypeScript and Vite.

## Technologies Used

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* CSS

## Instructions to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kwesibazil/qr-code-fm-001.git]
    cd [qr-code-fm-001/]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # Or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

4.  **Build for Production (Optional):**

    ```bash
    npm run build # Or yarn build
    ```

    This will create a `dist` folder containing the production-ready build of your application.


## Deployment
